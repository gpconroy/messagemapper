I would like to create a visual interface which can map from an ISO20022 message to a TransferMate API message.  We should be able to cross reference fields, detail which information cannot be carried across between messages and create and save mappings as the implementation of ISO20022 messages may differ.  Note the ISO20022 messages are typically XML and the TransferMate API messages are composed of JSON key value pairs, so the application should be able to deal with this.  

Potentially the message mapper could have wider implications than just TransferMate and ISO20022.  I may want to extend across other messages so I'd like it to be extensible and have the ability to use other message formats e.g. custom CSV formats translated into SQL DB schema structure.  The idea is to increase interoperability between systems so that they can talk to each other.
