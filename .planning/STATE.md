# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-11)

**Core value:** Clients can visually map fields between any two message formats and save those mappings for reuse — making system integration visible, configurable, and repeatable.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation & Infrastructure)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-11 — Roadmap created with 10 phases covering 30 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Next.js full-stack chosen for shared TypeScript types ideal for data-structure mapping
- Phase 1: Side-by-side panel UI pattern more intuitive than node canvas for field mapping
- Phase 1: PostgreSQL free cloud tier for cost-effective scalability
- Phase 1: Multi-tenant with client workspaces for external client isolation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 (Format Parser Registry):**
- XSD schema parsing has limited JavaScript ecosystem support — needs spike to evaluate libxmljs2 vs custom parser vs server-side approach

**Phase 5 (Transformation System):**
- Custom JavaScript transformation functions require sandbox isolation (VM2, isolated-vm, or WebAssembly) — security critical

**Phase 8 (Intelligence & Quality):**
- Auto-mapping algorithm selection needs research — multiple approaches possible (Levenshtein, soundex, semantic NLP, type scoring)
