<objective>
Human verification of all Phase 6 validation and testing features.

Purpose: Confirm that validation errors display correctly, type mismatch detection works, required field checking works, and sample data preview produces correct output.

Output: Human approval of Phase 6 features or list of issues to fix.

    CHECKPOINT: Human verification of Phase 6 features.

    What was built:
    1. Real-time validation engine detecting type mismatches and missing required fields
    2. Validation panel showing errors grouped by type with counts
    3. Field-level error indicators on the mapping canvas
    4. Sample data preview panel for testing transformations with real data

    How to verify - Start the dev server (npm run dev), navigate to http://localhost:3000/mapper:

    Test 1 - Required Field Validation:
    Upload source and target schemas. Without mappings, check validation panel shows missing required errors. Create mappings for required fields - errors should decrease.

    Test 2 - Type Mismatch Detection:
    Create a mapping between incompatible types (object to number). Validation panel should show type mismatch error. Add a transformation that resolves the mismatch - error should clear.

    Test 3 - Validation Panel UX:
    Check error/warning count badges. Expand/collapse panel. Verify errors grouped by type. When all resolved, verify green "All validations passed" message.

    Test 4 - Sample Data Preview:
    Create a mapping with a transformation. Enter valid JSON in preview panel. Click Run Preview. Verify transformation results with per-rule status. Test invalid JSON shows parse error.

    Test 5 - Field Error Indicators:
    With validation errors active, check field items for visual indicators (red/yellow dots). Hover for error message.

    Resume signal: Type "approved" if all tests pass, or describe specific issues found.
  </action>
  <verify>All 5 test scenarios pass human verification.</verify>
  <done>Human confirms validation errors appear for type mismatches, missing required fields, sample data preview works, and field-level indicators are visible.</done>

- Human confirms sample data preview shows transformation results
- Human confirms field-level error indicators are visible
- Human confirms validation panel UX is clear and usable
</success_criteria>
